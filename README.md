This website contains a simulated login page, that lead to the homepage.

The homepage contains a sticky nav bar that:
- Shows the weather at user's location, and offers a loading animation
- Greets the user with their nickname
- allows the user to increase a counter, which then plays a small animation and locks further increasing of the counter for 30 seconds

A scrollable list of demo content on the lower part of the screen, where each element has
- an image
- a head text
- a body of text
- a "#randomize" button, that changes head and body text randomly

A footer. Just footer.
